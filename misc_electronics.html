        <h2> Mice </h2>
        <p> Each mouse has a 555 Timer oscillating circuit glued to the belly, with photoresistors so they can interact with each other. They are now wired to string together like xmas lights but until I get a video of that here is a WIP video:

        <h2> Treble booster - pedal build from schematic </h2>

        <p>I got the schematic for this pedal fuzzcentral's site (<a href="http://fuzzcentral.ssguitar.com/rangemaster.php">http://fuzzcentral.ssguitar.com/rangemaster.php</a>). I had access to a PCB mill, so I used it for this project.</p>
        <p>Here's a screenshot of the schematic and board layout, made with Eagle</p>

        Here is the Othermill, and the finished circuit  </p>

    <p>
        And here is that same PCB populated with components. I later added a light. </p>

        <h2> Green Ringer - pedal build from schematic</h2>
        <p>A guitar pedal build from a schematic I found online: <a href="http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/effects-projects/octave/dan-armstrong-green-ringer/">http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/effects-projects/octave/dan-armstrong-green-ringer/</a></p>

        <p>Milling attempt 1 (made too big)</p><img src="images/pedals/green_ringer/green_ringer_milling1.PNG" style="max-width:80%" alt="PCB being made in an Othermill. This was my first attempt and it was too large to fit an enclosure." />

        <p>Milling attempt 2 (correctly sized)</p>

        A video I took of the milling process: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC9TfbezAU&t=7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC9TfbezAU&t=7s</a></p>

        <p>Here it is all assembled. I drilled the enclosure this time.</p>

    <p>I also perf-boarded this one.</p>

    <h2>Truck lamp repurpose</h2>
        <p> I was asked to help convert this headlamp from an old ERV into a desk lamp. I used a buck converter to tune the voltage to the desired brightness.
